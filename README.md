# ServiceHut App


Problem statement:
        Whenever you move into a new household, it can be hard to find professionals to work on your household needs or some other service that has to be done at your home. Say you need a proficient electrician to repair a broken light socket. Unless you are familiar with your neighborhood, it would be hard to find an electrician to fix it.

Our Solution:
        Here is the solution to all the problems listed above. ServiceHut is a mobile app that connects clients and service providers via GPS (Global Positioning System). Clients request home services, and based on the client's location (latitude and longitude), the nearest service provider is assigned to serve the client's needs.
        
Abstract:
       Mobile Applications have become an integral part of our life, whether for personal use, corporate tasks, or leisure. "ServiceHut" is a corporate-based mobile application for Android users that connects clients and service providers via GPS (GlobalPositioning System). Clients request home services, and based on the client's location (latitude and longitude), the nearest service provider is assigned to serve the client's needs. By improving an existing system application that does not include GPS, this application offers a broad possibility for integrating maps to allow drag and drop to another location and making this programme available to others.
